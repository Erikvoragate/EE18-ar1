        <p>2005–2013: Formation and debut album
            The Met brothers initially began writing, producing and mixing their own material in the living room of their Chelsea apartment in Manhattan, New York, focusing on DIY indie pop music. They began performing around 2006, busking in Central Park and Washington Square Park. They began their musical talents when Jack played the harmonica, Ryan played the piano, and Adam played the bass. However, currently they play various different instruments. They began by performing covers,[6] but now compose original music influenced by musicians such as the Beach Boys, Simon and Garfunkel, Vampire Weekend, Jon Bellion, Imagine Dragons, The Beatles,[notes 1] Kanye West, Macklemore, Twenty One Pilots, and Fun.[7]</p>
